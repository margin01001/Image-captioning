from keras.models import Model, load_model
import numpy as np# for loading input_vocab
# index of '<start>' is 3




##### PREPROCESSING IMAGES:

# loading image with target_size (224, 224) and converting to array
img = image.img_to_array(image.load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224)))
# expanding dimension of image
img = img.reshape(-1, 224, 224, 3)
# vgg16 preprocess
img = preprocess_input(img)

encoder = load_model('model_path')
img_feat = encoder.predict(img)

########## Try-out
1. Try to import vgg16 at real time because vgg16 model is around 500mb which is a bit concerning 
    from cloud point-of-view
